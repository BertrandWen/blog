## Russell's advices

<!-- > **Interviewer:**  
> Suppose Lord Russell that this film were to be looked at by our descendants, like a dead sea scroll in a thousand years time. What would you think it’s worth telling that generation about the life you’ve lived and the lessons you’ve learned from it?

> **Russell:**  
> I should like to say two things, one intellectual and one moral.  
> The intellectual thing I should want to say to them, is this: When you are studying any matter, or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out. Never let yourself be diverted, either by what you wish to believe, or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed. But look only, and solely, at what are the facts. That is the intellectual thing that I should wish to say.  
> The moral thing I should wish to say to them is very simple: I should say, love is wise, hatred is foolish. In this world, which is getting more and more closely interconnected, we have to learn to tolerate each other, we have to learn to put up with the fact that some people say things that we don’t like. We can only live together in that way—and if we are to live together and not die together—we must learn a kind of charity and a kind of tolerance, which is absolutely vital to the continuation of human life on this planet.

> I believe in reincarnation. Not in the traditional sense. My feeling is that I have lived many different lives within this lifetime. I've also observed that each new incarnation came about after a period of intense physical and/or emotional pain. In other words, just like childbirth, it hurts to be born. Or reborn. A lot of crying happens. Death, illness, poverty, divorce, giving up a dream, waking up from a dream, getting fired, divorce again, substance abuse, being publicly ridiculed by a former friend - all these things have led to rebirth. To new lives.

>The Buddha taught that change and impermanence is a fundamental fact of existence. He further pointed out that this fact made suffering inevitable. He didn't mention that sometimes, after the pain is gone, you open your eyes to a life beyond your wildest dreams. That's what happened to me. But I know that this too shall pass. There's a cosmic uterus up ahead, I just can't see it yet.
