## 世纪三部曲

> 2023-02-25

坦白说，尽管我喜欢它，但我不觉得这是一套好书。

它好看，它激起了我对世界与历史的兴趣，但它同时也包括许多偏见，许多臆造的指责，许多有意无意的引导，尽管作为小说而言如何去编排情节是作者的自由，但是如果内容上能更少一些自以为正确的看法，多一些更客观，更真实的历史，从而给读者更多去思考和评判的空间，它应该会成为一部更好的书。此外，在书中所控诉的言论管控如此严重的社会中，这本书被光明正大地阅读与讨论，也不失为一种讽刺了。

就我而言，贯穿于三部书中间的反战思想是这套小说最闪亮的价值了。无论何时，战争都是人类文明中是最深刻，最残忍的主题。在这个有许多国家，政党和人口的星球上，在各种利益和文化的交织与冲突中，和平实属来之不易，我想每个人都应该为争取和维护它而作最大的努力。

最后，还是用 Bob Dylan 的 blowing in the wind来作为这套小说的感触总结吧：

How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, and how many years must a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
And how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
Yes, and how many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
And how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take 'til he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
